            Our founding partner, Mr. Donaldson established Donaldson Attorneys in late 2020 after many years of working
            as first an attorney, and later an Advocate, in both private practice and various corporate positions.
            Despite our relatively short existence, we have already grown to such an extent that only two months after
            commencing trading, we already needed to appoint another attorney to assist with our rapidly expanding
            business. With our highly driven team and the mentorship of Mr. Donaldson, we expect to become one of the
            leading law firms in the country within the next 10 years.

          Having completed his two honours degrees at the University of Cape Town, Mr Donaldson went on to complete his
          articles under the direct mentorship of William Booth (who acted as the Chairperson of the Criminal Law
          Society
          at the time and ran what is widely regarded as the top criminal law firm in Cape Town). Having thereafter run
          his own law firm for some time in Cape Town, Mr Donaldson accepted a corporate position in Johannesburg as a
          national litigation manager, before joining the Bar as an Advocate where he practiced primarily in Commercial
          and Labour Law. Thereafter, Adv Donaldson (as he was then) went on to head up The Labour Counsel as its
          Managing
          Director. Having done this for approximately five years, Adv. Donaldson converted back to being an attorney
          and
          immediately opened Donaldson Attorneys Incorporated which has seen exceptional growth based on its success
          rate
          and client relationships.

          In a similar fashion to Mr Donaldson, Ms van Straaten has been employed as an attorney / Professional
          Assistant at two different law firms, as an Associate at The Labour Counsel and “Head of Legal” for a large
          corporation. As a result of the aforementioned, Ms van Straaten has excelled in debt collection and compliance
          management as well as Labour and Family Law. A notable competency of Ms van Straaten is corporate
          restructurings where she has experienced exceptional success, having furthermore recently won a contentious
          S189A dispute in the Labour Court where her accelerated process was unsuccessfully challenged by NUMSA. She
          provided her professional legal services in various fields of law including Commercial Work, Contracts, Civil
          & Criminal Law, Deceased Estates, Divorce, Maintenance, Evictions, Liquidations and Sequestrations and have

          Mr Botha comes from a commercial background, having previously worked at two of the most successful labour
          consultancies in the country in corporate consultancy positions, Mr Botha however decided that he was not
          making the most of his LLB and therefore decided to initiate the process which would ultimately result in him
          becoming an admitted attorney. His corporate background gives him unique insights into legal practice and is
          an advantage that he enjoys over many of his colleagues.
